      <description>i basically wanted to have a random zoom on an interesting mandelbrot point because:
 i wanted to try out rust in an aws lambda function i wanted to build that lambda function with cdk i was kinda hyped to use rust after reading about it  what i learned
 i think i like aws better than gcp. i really really really like rust and will keep using it as much as i can i will never ever find mandelbrot set uninteresting  if you&amp;rsquo;re into it, you can find the source code in here</description>

Deep Learning with Python: Currently reading it.  2021  Designing data intensive applications: can&amp;rsquo;t recomend it enough. Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development: i love rust and this is a great book but afaik outside of all the (wonderful) cli tooling being built in rust, i see more interesting projects being built with go (if you could point me to some interesting rust projects, i would love to see them!</description>

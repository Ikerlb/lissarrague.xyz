      <description>2021  Designing data intensive applications: can&amp;rsquo;t recomend it enough. Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development: i love rust and this is a great book but afaik outside of all the (wonderful) cli tooling being built in rust, i see more interesting projects being built with go (if you could point me to some interesting rust projects, i would love to see them!). which led me to the my next book Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach to Real-World Go Programming: the book is ok but as much as i try i can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get really excited about go.</description>

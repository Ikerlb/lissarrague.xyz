using a stack, you can figure out exactly where does the string become invalid, if at all
m = {&amp;#34;{&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;}&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;(&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;[&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;]&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;&amp;lt;&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;#34;} def parse(l): s = [] for c in l: if c in m: s.append(c) elif s and m[s[-1]] == c: s.pop() else: return s, c return s, None if the stack is not empty at the end, it means it is incomplete and that the only way to complete it would be to reverse the stack and append it to the original string</description>

for part one, simply count the number of cells in which all neighbors are strictly greater.
for part two, floodfill until you have previously visited or until you find a height 9
def floodfill(grid, r, c): if grid[r][c] is None or grid[r][c] == 9: return 0 s, grid[r][c] = 1, None for nr, nc in neighbors(grid, r, c): s += floodfill(grid, nr, nc) return s </description>

for the first part, simply count the number of words in the output section that have lengths 2, 3, 4 or 7
for the second part, i couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of a better solution than just try permutations until the wires make sense</description>

def cost(l, n, f): return sum(f(e, n) for e in l) for the first part, the solution is the median.
def median(l): return l[len(l) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1] def part1(l): m = median(l) return cost(l, m, lambda x, y: abs(x - y)) for the second part, the solution is the average.
def part2(l): avg = sum(l) / len(l) f = lambda x, y: gauss(abs(x - y)) return min(cost(l, ceil(avg), f), cost(l, floor(avg), f)) </description>

this was very fun!
my first solution consisted on a simple simulation on a double ended queue. this solution is linear on the number of days and it handles both parts without a problem.
# mutates q def step(q): n, last = q[0], q.pop() q[-1] += n q.append(last) q.rotate(-1) however, it ocurred to me while working, that i could simply simulate a single step of this as a matrix multiplication.</description>

nothing interesting for this problem. just walk from p1 to p2 and add all the points you walk to a counter. for part one, simply filter those who are diagonal (start[1] == end[1] or start[0] == end[0])
for part two, don&amp;rsquo;t filter.
def span(p1, p2): sx, sy = p1 ex, ey = p2 dx = delta(sx, ex) dy = delta(sy, ey) while p1 !</description>

ok. this was fun!
for both parts, i just simulated all boards with a class. only interesting thing is i kept track of all numbers contained in a board and added a rows and cols array, containing how many remaining numbers until a bingo in each row/col. this made it very easy to know if marking a number in a board yields a bingo.</description>

to solve each part, we basically need a function that can give us the number of bits turned on for a certain digit index:
def count_by_index(nums, i): total = len(nums) res = ones = 0 for n in nums: if (n &amp;gt;&amp;gt; i) &amp;amp; 1: ones += 1 return ones, total - ones you can get the gamma rate by simply iterating over each possible index and assigning that index to be the digit of the most common digit of all numbers for that index.</description>

for part one, it is a very straight forward simulation.
(defn step-part1 [x y cmd i] (cond (= cmd &amp;#34;forward&amp;#34;) [(+ x i) y] (= cmd &amp;#34;up&amp;#34;) [x (- y i)] :else [x (+ y i)])) part two is very similar but we also need to keep track of the aim
(defn step-part2 [x y aim cmd i] (cond (= cmd &amp;#34;forward&amp;#34;) [(+ x i) (- y (* aim i)) aim] (= cmd &amp;#34;up&amp;#34;) [x y (+ aim i)] :else [x y (- aim i)]))	</description>

well my solution uses a very simple (fixed size) sliding window technique, with the first part being a size 1 window and the second part a size 3 window.
def solve(l: [int], k: int): s = sum(l[:k]) res = 0 for i in range(k, len(l)): ss = s - l[i - k] + l[i] res += s &amp;lt; ss s = ss return res </description>

      <description>i basically wanted to have a random zoom on an interesting mandelbrot point because:
 i wanted to try out rust in an aws lambda function i wanted to build that lambda function with cdk i was kinda hyped to use rust after reading about it  what i learned
 i think i like aws better than gcp. i really really really like rust and will keep using it as much as i can i will never ever find mandelbrot set uninteresting  if you&amp;rsquo;re into it, you can find the source code in here</description>

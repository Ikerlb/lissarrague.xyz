      <description>click to see demo! i basically wanted to have a random zoom on an interesting mandelbrot point because:
 i wanted to try out rust in an aws lambda function i wanted to build that lambda function with cdk (i&amp;rsquo;m kinda procrastinating from learning/using terraform) i was kinda hyped to use rust after reading about it  what i learned
 i&amp;rsquo;m starting to dig aws hehe. i really really really like rust and will keep using it as much as i can i will never ever find mandelbrot set uninteresting rust lambda startup time is unlike anything i&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.</description>

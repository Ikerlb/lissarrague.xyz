## 2021

- [Designing data intensive applications](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=data+intensive+applications&qid=1642484281&sprefix=data+intens%2Caps%2C90&sr=8-1): can't recomend it enough. 
- [Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development](https://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/B0979PWD4Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o06?ie=UTF8&psc=1): i love rust and this is a great book but afaik outside of all the (wonderful) cli tooling being built in rust, i see more interesting projects being built with go (if you could point me to some interesting rust projects, i would love to see them!). which led me to the my next book
- [Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach to Real-World Go Programming](https://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/B08XYGCM71/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o05?ie=UTF8&psc=1): the book is ok but as much as i try i can't seem to get really excited about go. 
- [The joy of Clojure](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Joy-Clojure-Thinking-Way/dp/1935182641/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_MX=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=39K0SIJDUIEPJ&keywords=the+clojure+way&qid=1642485176&sprefix=the+clojure+way%2Caps%2C106&sr=8-1): i had a really really good time both reading this book and learning clojure overall. there are some very interesting concepts in this languages and it pushed me outside of my comfort zone at first (this was also my first lisp, so yeah...).
- [Purely Functional Data Structures](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Purely-Functional-Data-Structures-English-ebook/dp/B00AKE1V04/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1642485542&sr=8-1): if only the book was based on haskell... i have not finished this book but i REALLY want to both finish it and get a little more used to Standard ML
- I'll finish this list later :p

### what?
 good old ray tracer again
 
![final scene](/ray-tracer/rust-spheres.png)

### why?
 * earlier last year i followed [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) and implemented it in go to get a hang of the language. it was all nice and fun but rendering the final scene took arround 20 minutes in my M1 Macbook Air, so i was left feeling a little disatisfied.
 * i have been solving many [_kattis_](https://open.kattis.com) problems in rust (particularly those that are just too slow to run in python), and i wanted to try rust on a slightly more complicated 'project'
 * i really wanted to see how rust concurrency feels.

### conclusions
 * computer graphics are very hard to debug. really. really. hard. i spent days fixing a very subtle bug.
 * i started defining a trait 'hitable' and was planning to just extend types as i needed them, but as i started testing it, it really wasn't any faster than the go version. so i decided to replace as many allocations as possible and not use any dynamic dispatch and i think i'm happy with the results. i think rust enums make up for the lack of abstractness in this scenario
 * [_rayon_](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/) is cool and very very simple

### todo
  * lights! 
  * more materials!
  * more geometries!
  * textures!

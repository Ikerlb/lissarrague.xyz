### what?
i basically wanted to have a random zoom on an interesting mandelbrot point:
```
-0.761574 + -0.0847596i 
```

### why?

  * i wanted to try out rust in an aws lambda function	
  * i wanted to build that lambda function with cdk (i'm kinda procrastinating from learning/using terraform)
  * i was kinda hyped to use rust after reading about it

### conclusions
  * i'm starting to dig aws hehe.
  * i **really** like rust and will keep using it as much as i can
  * i will never ever find mandelbrot set uninteresting 
  * rust lambda startup time is unlike anything i've ever seen. it draws (for me, at least) the line between server and serverless kinda blurry

### todo
  * well this seems obvious but i don't want to use a single point and a random zoom but rather a set of interesting points and a random zoom! all this seems kinda time consuming so i guess i'll leave it like this for a while
  * i also want to optimize mb allocated for each lambda execution. 128mb takes arround 13 seconds to finish, while 1gb takes arround 3.

### update 10-5-2022
  * i've been consuming a lot of terraform content. but as you may know by now, in the realm of programming you learn mostly by getting your hands dirty, so i tried importing (this is the single feature i liked the most) most of the resources i used on cdk and got them up & running in terraform. it is beautiful.

i basically wanted to have a random zoom on an interesting mandelbrot point because:
  * i wanted to try out rust in an aws lambda function	
  * i wanted to build that lambda function with cdk
  * i was kinda hyped to use rust after reading about it

what i learned
  * i think i like aws better than gcp.
  * i really really really like rust and will keep using it as much as i can
  * i will never ever find mandelbrot set uninteresting

if you're into it, you can find the source code in [here](https://github.com/Ikerlb/mandelrust-lambda)

and, of course, a very simple [demo](https://lissarrague.xyz/mandelrust/) that uses the lambda function (beware: long cold starts ahead)
